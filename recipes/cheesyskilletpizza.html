    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.</li>
        <li><b>Cook's Notes:</b> The crust is delicate and thin, so don't overload with toppings, Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
